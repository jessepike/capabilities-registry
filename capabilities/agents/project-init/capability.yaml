description: >-
  ADF Project Initialization Agent — bootstraps ADF project structure from an existing concept
  brief. Creates folders, moves files, configures git, drafts initial intent.md from brief content,
  and validates structure. Infrastructure setup and initial intent extraction only — does not do
  full Discover stage work.
