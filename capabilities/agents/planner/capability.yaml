description: 'Planning Agent — implements the ADF-PLANNING-SPEC methodology. Decomposes
  intent into executable work organized for parallel execution by agents with verified
  capabilities. Runs the seven-step planning process: understand intent, decompose
  into work units, organize phases, parallelization strategy, capability assessment
  (hard gate), testing strategy, risk/contingency. Produces plan.md and tasks.md drafts.
  Subordinate to Work Manager in the Work Management hierarchy.'
